# StartItUp

### 1. Introduction
An application that programmatically executes other scripts/apps.
It has a list of available profiles which are developed to interact with certain apps/scripts.

This app comes from my very personal reason. While I was working on different projects, I usually had to run some scripts/apps to make my development environment be ready whenever I turned on my computer.
Some apps do not only require to be executed but perform some clicks under certain conditions.

I had had to write different apps/scripts to automatically do all these things, but all implementations had been separated, I had not reused anything.
Until recently, I decided to create an app with a long-term enhancement, I do not have to write everything from scratch again, so I chose to make it extendable by developing the app with dynamic libraries.

That is all about why this project has been started.
